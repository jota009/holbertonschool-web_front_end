# Techium Webpage Project

## 💡 Project Overview

In this exercise you will learn how to structure an HTML5 page using semantic tags only. No CSS or styling is required: the goal is to master correct markup, not appearance.

## 📚 Resources

- [HTML 5.2 Specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/)
- [MDN: HTML: HyperText Markup Language](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
- [HTML Reference](https://htmlreference.io/)
- [Can I use…](https://caniuse.com/)
- [HTML Cheat Sheet](https://websitesetup.org/html5-cheat-sheet/)

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this project you’ll be able to:

1. Describe best practices and guidelines for writing HTML
2. Build the HTML5 “skeleton” (`<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`)
3. Use semantic elements (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<aside>`, `<footer>`) appropriately
4. Explain when to use `<div>` vs. `<span>`
5. Structure headings in hierarchical order (`<h1>`→`<h2>`→…`)
6. Build ordered (`<ol>`) and unordered lists (`<ul>`)
7. Embed images (`<img>`) and understand media formats (SVG, GIF, PNG, JPG)
8. Create data tables (`<table>`, `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, `<tr>`, `<th>`, `<td>`)
9. Integrate video (`<video>`) and audio (`<audio>`) files
10. Embed external content (`<iframe>`, `<embed>`)
11. Validate your markup with the [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)

## ✅ Requirements

- All HTML must pass W3C validation.
- The project folder must include this `README.md` at its root.
- Throughout your pages, the company name **Techium** should appear in the `<title>` and in your header.
